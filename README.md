# Cross-Robot Transfer of Reinforcement Learning Agents

This project addresses the challenge of transferring knowledge between two different industrial robots, i.e. different kinematics.

The proposed approach is executed in four stages:

1. Generate expert knowledge
2. Generate domain mappings
3. Transfer expert knowledge to target domain
4. Boost target agent
